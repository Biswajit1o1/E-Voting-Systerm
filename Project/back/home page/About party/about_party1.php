               It was accorded national party status on 7 June 2019. It is the first 
			   political party from Northeastern India to have attained this status.
			   In January 2013, P. A. Sangma launched the party on the national level.
			   He announced that his party would be in alliance with the National 
			   Democratic Alliance led by Bharatiya Janta Party. Sangma also reiterated
			   that though the membership of the party is open to all, it shall be a
			   tribalcentric party.

			   Sangma who has been a nine-time Member of Parliament, had announced to
			   form a new political party soon after his expulsion from the Nationalist
			   Congress Party in July 2012, when he refused to accept party decision to
			   quit the 2012 Indian presidential election.
